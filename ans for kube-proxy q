There is a long history of DNS implementations not respecting record TTLs, and caching the results of name lookups after they should have expired.
Some apps do DNS lookups only once and cache the results indefinitely.
Even if apps and libraries did proper re-resolution, the low or zero TTLs on the DNS records could impose a high load on DNS that then becomes difficult to manage
